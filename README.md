# ✈️ Airline Management System

A simple Airline Management System to simulate basic operations such as flight booking, ticket cancellation, and passenger management. This project demonstrates core object-oriented programming concepts and a console-based menu system.

## 📌 Features

- Book flight tickets
- Cancel booked tickets
- View available flights
- Manage passenger information
- Display booking summary
- Exit system

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- C++ (Object-Oriented Programming)
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- File Handling (if applicable)
- Console-based UI
