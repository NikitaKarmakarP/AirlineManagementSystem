# ✈️ Airline Management System

A simple Airline Management System to simulate basic operations such as flight booking, ticket cancellation, and passenger management. This project demonstrates core object-oriented programming concepts and a console-based menu system.

## 📌 Features

- Book flight tickets
- Cancel booked tickets
- View available flights
- Manage passenger information
- Display booking summary
- Exit system

## 🎯 Why I Built This

I created this project to strengthen my understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and how real-world systems, like airline booking platforms, operate behind the scenes. 

While working on this project, I aimed to:

- Simulate a real-life ticket booking and reservation system.
- Practice building a modular and extensible C++ application.
- Enhance my skills in solving real-world problems through clean code and design principles.
- Build a portfolio project that demonstrates my ability to apply programming concepts to real-world scenarios, useful for internships and job opportunities.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **C++**: Core programming language used to implement the entire system.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Applied concepts like classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- **File Handling** *(optional)*: To store and retrieve booking data locally (can be added for future enhancements).
- **Standard Template Library (STL)**: Utilized STL containers where applicable (e.g., vectors).

> 🚀 Future scope includes integrating with databases (MySQL) and adding GUI frameworks like Qt for a richer user experience.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NikitaKarmakarP/AirlineManagementSystem.git
   cd AirlineManagementSystem
   
2. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ AirlineManagementSystem.cpp -o AirlineSystem

4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./AirlineSystem

## 🎯 Purpose  
This project is designed to:

- Practice OOP concepts like classes, inheritance, and encapsulation.  
- Understand the logic behind ticketing and booking systems.  
- Prepare for technical interviews with real-world simulations.  

## 📖 Future Enhancements  
- Add login/registration system  
- Integration with a database (e.g., MySQL)  
- Improve UI/UX with GUI (Qt or other frameworks)  
- Handle seat assignment and flight schedules dynamically
