# ✈️ Airline Management System

A simple Airline Management System to simulate basic operations such as flight booking, ticket cancellation, and passenger management. This project demonstrates core object-oriented programming concepts and a console-based menu system.

## 📌 Features

- Book flight tickets
- Cancel booked tickets
- View available flights
- Manage passenger information
- Display booking summary
- Exit system

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- C++ (Object-Oriented Programming)
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- File Handling (if applicable)
- Console-based UI

## 📂 Project Structure

/AirlineManagementSystem ┣ AirlineManagementSystem.cpp ┣ README.md ┗ (other files if any)


## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NikitaKarmakarP/AirlineManagementSystem.git

3. Run the program:

./AirlineSystem

## 🎯 Purpose
This project is designed to:

- Practice OOP concepts like classes, inheritance, and encapsulation.
- Understand the logic behind ticketing and booking systems.
- Prepare for technical interviews with real-world simulations.

## 📖 Future Enhancements
 - Add login/registration system
- Integration with a database (e.g., MySQL)
- Improve UI/UX with GUI (Qt or other frameworks)
- Handle seat assignment and flight schedules dynamically
